    Add Notes functionality and polish dashboard UI
    
    - Implemented NoteDetailView with support for title, content, date, and optional image display.
    - Created NotesListView with scrollable list, clean layout, and swipe-to-delete support.
    - Enhanced note rows with:
      • Thumbnail preview if image is attached
      • Room badge for context
      • Date formatting and content snippet
    - Connected NotesListView to HomeDetailView via dashboard tile
    - Hooked up "Add Note" button to generate new notes with default values
    - Ensured previews run correctly with seeded PreviewData
    - Debugged and corrected default ContentView entry point from initial template
    
    This sets a solid foundation for journaling and future feed-style tracking via HomeFeedView.
